# Mass-upload-nfts-to-opensea-bot


To create a Python bot that mass uploads NFTs to OpenSea from pictures on your desktop, you will need to use the OpenSea API as well as a library for reading and processing images.

Here is an example of how you could use the OpenSea API and the Pillow library to mass upload NFTs in Python
This code uses the requests and Pillow libraries to read image files from a directory on your desktop, generate unique IDs for each NFT, and then use the OpenSea API to create a new asset on OpenSea for each NFT.

You will need to modify this code to use your own OpenSea API key, NFT contract address, and image directory. You may also want to customize the error handling and response handling. Additionally, note that the OpenSea API has rate limits, so you may need to use a delay or pagination to avoid hitting those limits.
